<p class="p2">Going into this class I knew nothing about coding and was frankly intimidated by the foreign nature of it, but it turns out that coding is not nearly as hard as I thought! <br><br> 
    HTML is relatively straight forward and most of the work that I had to do when learning it was just the formatting; even the specific tags we use don't need to be completely <br><br>
    memorized since there are many resources online that provide the list of tags for you.</p>
    <br>
<p class="p2">My first line of code was probably like most people's, which was simply printing out "Hello World!" It took me a little while to grasp the coding format, especially dealing with VSCode <br><br> 
    and creating a repository, but eventually everything started to click. FreeCodeCamp was an excellent resource that I utilized as well to get better with HTML, since each exercise showed <br><br>
    you in real time what each tag was accomplishing on your webpage. I recommend FreeCodeCamp to anyone who is just starting to learn HTML like I was. Like the name implies, <br><br>
    it's free and all you need is an email. If you want to visit the site you can <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"> click here</a>.</p>

<p class="p2">Now after learning the basics of HTML I felt a bit limited in my creativity when it came to text and overall webpage stylization. CSS came as a breath of fresh air <br><br>
    for me and made me even more excited to code, since it modifies HTML to allow custom fonts, colors, and webpage properties. Now I was customizing things that made my work look <br><br>
    like a real website. I could create borders and boxes that stuck to one part of the screen when scrolling, create custom webpage color schemes, and edit properties of text when <br><br>
    the mouse hovers over it. The process for implementing CSS is actually a lot easier than cramming class edits above and below your work on your index page. You link a style <br><br>
    page to your work and all of your customization is done on a separate page, which is much more organized and looks way cleaner in my opinion.</p>

<p>This is an example of a paragraph for HTML. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
<br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p> Example HTML formatting sentence: <br> The man put his <b> hand</b> on a <b> hot stove</b> and said, <q><em>Ouch!</em></q> at <time>5:00pm</time></p>
<!-- I wanted to show the range the code can provide within written sentences, so I used tags such as "<b>" to bold certain important words, "<q>" to specify what the man said, "<em>" to more clearly format the man's exclamation, and "<time>" to dedicate when this scenario took place.

<!-- There are too many genres of music to list so I gave the user the freedom to input anything via a submission form tag. I labelled the form "favgenre."
    For the would you rather portion, I created a drop down list using the selection tag with two selection values of "yes" and "no" as well as an additional blank option to keep the default selection blank.



<p> To learn more about Hip Hop music, you can visit this <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjOxuLzxpL6AhWpATQIHZfjC6cQFnoECAcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHip_hop_music&usg=AOvVaw1qmbdUtDopvnHQeip_nwzW">link</a></p>

<p> Although this is not typically the music I listen to, but you can find all sorts of royalty free music from all genres including hip hop via youtube if you ever need music for a project (like this HTML one)

<!-- I wanted to include a music video to further emphasize the theme of music that I started to go with. I saved a video from the internet 
in my github folder and used the source feature to display the video from the folder within my video controls tab. The quality wasn't the highest
when doing a free download from a converter so I added a link tag so that the person can view the video from the origial source. I also
made sure to state where the content was from in a paragraph tag since it is not my own original content-->
