<div class="myDiv">
<p>This is an example of a paragraph for HTML. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
<br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
<!-- I used the tag "<br>" to add a line break to better format the Lorem Ipsum example paragraph-->

<p> Example HTML formatting sentence: <br> The man put his <b> hand</b> on a <b> hot stove</b> and said, <q><em>Ouch!</em></q> at <time>5:00pm</time></p>
<!-- I wanted to show the range the code can provide within written sentences, so I used tags such as "<b>" to bold certain important words, "<q>" to specify what the man said, "<em>" to more clearly format the man's exclamation, and "<time>" to dedicate when this scenario took place.-->

<!-- There are too many genres of music to list so I gave the user the freedom to input anything via a submission form tag. I labelled the form "favgenre."
    For the would you rather portion, I created a drop down list using the selection tag with two selection values of "yes" and "no" as well as an additional blank option to keep the default selection blank.-->

<p> Although this is not typically the music I listen to, but you can find all sorts of royalty free music from all genres including hip hop via youtube if you ever need music for a project (like this HTML one)

<!-- I wanted to include a music video to further emphasize the theme of music that I started to go with. I saved a video from the internet 
in my github folder and used the source feature to display the video from the folder within my video controls tab. The quality wasn't the highest
when doing a free download from a converter so I added a link tag so that the person can view the video from the origial source. I also
made sure to state where the content was from in a paragraph tag since it is not my own original content-->
