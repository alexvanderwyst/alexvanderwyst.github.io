<p class="p2"> I've used wordpress in the past for other class assignments such as writing journals and whatnot but this is the first time I used it alongside a web template. I think that wordpress is a great introduction into sitebuilding that doesn't require <br>
    coding; that ended up being my only gripe with this assignment, since I had just learned how to code and wanted to keep applying it. I understand the concept of the assignment is to learn what makes a webpage look good, which was stil valuable for me.</p>
    <br>

<br><br><br>

<p class="p2">The webpages created were under a free trial license just for the sake of the assignments in class so I couldn't link to the actual pages, but the screenshots are attached within the hyperlinks.</p>

<p class="p2"> As for squarespace I was far more impressed with the design options over wordpress based on the sheer amount of templates. Although wordpress had a photo library, I found that squarespace for 
    had so many built in effects and text options to utilized comparataively. <br>
     Wordpress feels like a great stepping stone into squarespace but I still wasn’t personally creative process though and I found that since I wasn’t focused on coding the actual <br>
     structure of the website I could focus more on the content and creative elements of the site, which I did by creating a site for a makeshift band my friend and I would be in. </p>
